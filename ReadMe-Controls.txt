L: toggle the lights on and off for the lamp

Press 'O' to continuously launch grenade attacks every 3 sec. Press 'O' again to toggle the attack ON/OFF. 
The code for launching it is inside of the keyPressed which just changes a boolean. 
This code can be moved into the AI controller in the future. 
The code that handles the collision between the grenade and player, and decreases the health is inside an if statement within checkForCollision()
